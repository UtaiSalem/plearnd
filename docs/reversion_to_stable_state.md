# Reversion to Stable State Documentation

## Overview
This document documents the reversion process performed on October 22, 2025, to revert the Plearnd application to a more stable state before intensive changes made over the past 2 days.

## Problem Statement
After 2 days of intensive development work, numerous changes were made but the results were not meeting expectations. The decision was made to revert to a more stable point before the recent intensive changes.

## Reversion Process

### 1. Backup Creation
- Created a backup branch named `backup_before_revert` containing all current changes
- Pushed the backup branch to remote repository for safety

### 2. Identification of Stable Commit
After analyzing the Git history, commit `f96de15` was identified as the most stable point before the intensive changes.
- Commit hash: f96de15
- Commit message: "fix: upgrade Vite to v5.4.0 and resolve CORS/bundling issues"
- This commit represented a stable state with working Vite configuration and resolved CORS issues

### 3. Reverted Changes

### 4. Current State
The application has been successfully reverted to commit `f96de15` on a new branch named `revert_to_stable`.
- The Play Learn Earn structure is already in place at this point
- Controllers are organized under app/Http/Controllers/Play/, Learn/, and Earn/
- Models are organized under app/Models/Play/, Learn/, and Earn/
- Routes are organized under routes/play/, learn/, and earn/

## Next Steps
1. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work correctly
2. If needed, selectively reapply any specific changes that were beneficial from the reverted commits
3. Consider creating a new development branch from this stable point for future work

## Recovery Instructions
If you need to return to the pre-reversion state:
1. Checkout the `backup_before_revert` branch
2. Run `git stash pop` to restore any stashed changes
3. Test and fix any issues as needed

## Branches Created
- `backup_before_revert`: Contains all changes before reversion
- `revert_to_stable`: The application reverted to the stable commit f96de15

Both branches have been pushed to the remote repository for safety and collaboration.
