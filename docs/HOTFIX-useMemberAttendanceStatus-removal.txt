REAL-TIME ATTENDANCE ERROR FIX - November 1, 2025
=============================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
- 500 Internal Server Error on /attendances/{id}/member-status/{memberId}
- useMemberAttendanceStatus.js was still being used by components
- EnhancedAttendanceStatus.vue was making API calls to non-existent endpoint
- Multiple 500 errors flooding the console on attendance page load

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Previous removal was incomplete. The following files were missed:
1. useMemberAttendanceStatus.js (composable)
2. RealTimeAttendanceDemo.vue (demo component)
3. EnhancedAttendanceStatus.vue (still importing deleted composable)

SOLUTION:
---------
 DELETED: resources/js/Composables/useMemberAttendanceStatus.js
 DELETED: resources/js/PlearndComponents/learn/courses/attendances/RealTimeAttendanceDemo.vue
 FIXED: EnhancedAttendanceStatus.vue

   - Removed API calls (fetchMemberStatus)
   - Removed loading/error/network status states
   - Changed to simple static display using initialStatus prop only

   - Reduced from 216 lines to 137 lines

VERIFICATION:
-------------
 No more 500 errors
 No API calls to /attendances/{id}/member-status/{memberId}
 EnhancedAttendanceStatus displays status from props only
 MembersAttendanceDetails.vue continues to work (shows status icons)
 No syntax errors in modified files
